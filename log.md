# 100 Days Of Code - Log

*Background: Received BS Computer Science in 2011, cum laude. However, due to some circumstances, did not go into tech. Currently working full-time, but realized coding is what I **really** want to do!*

#### Goals:
- Refresh basic computer science knowledge (by completing Harvard's CS50 course)
- Create own projects


### Day 1: November 8, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Successfully implemented 2 out of 3 exercises in problem set 4 of CS50 (whodunit and resize less).

**Thoughts** This course is really challenging! I am surprised at the level of complexity they teach supposedly beginners. On the other hand, it's also really rewarding when you finally get it 100% right!
