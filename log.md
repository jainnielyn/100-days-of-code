# 100 Days Of Code - Log

*Background: Received BS Computer Science in 2011, cum laude. However, due to some circumstances, did not go into tech. Currently working full-time, but realized coding is what I **really** want to do!*

#### Goals:
- Refresh basic computer science knowledge (by completing Harvard's CS50 course). Will not be uploading code for this (no cheating!).
- Create own projects


### Day 1: November 8, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Successfully implemented 2 out of 3 exercises in problem set 4 of CS50 (whodunit and resize less).

**Thoughts** This course is really challenging! I am surprised at the level of complexity they teach supposedly beginners. On the other hand, it's also really rewarding when you finally get it 100% right!

### Day 2: November 9, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Coded recover exercise. This completes pset4!!

**Thoughts** Had a tough time understanding pointers (* and &) and fopen/fwrite/fread.

### Day 3: November 10, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Watched lecture for week 5 of CS50. Learned more about pointers in C, and some intro to linked lists.

**Thoughts** I understand malloc, but it hasn't really sunk in. Maybe when I start using it...<br/>


### Day 4: November 11, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: A little relaxed on a Sunday, but still watched the short videos pre-coding exercises.

**Thoughts** Excited to use data structures, linked lists, queues and stacks!<br/>


### Day 5: November 12, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed all short videos of week 5 (data structures). Started looking over problem set 5, speller.

**Thoughts** Somehow, even after completing problem sets 1 through 4, whenever I go through the next specifications, it feels daunting. "Omg this is so difficult."<br/>
