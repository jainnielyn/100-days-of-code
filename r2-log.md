# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - Jainnielyn Ching

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge, round 2! Fell off the wagon last time, was too inundated by worry. Let's try this again. 
Started on October 6, 2019.

## Log

### R1D1 
Was stuck on Udacity's Android Basics, Miwok app - Lesson 4 #15-16 where I need to change the color of a section of the screen, depending on which category was clicked. My first trial was ultimately the correct way to do it (efficient, etc.) but I couldn't get through the error messages. I then tried other more brute force ways, and got it to work. 

After watching the solution video, realized my original plan was the correct one, so reversed the brute force code, went back where I got stuck and realized why it wasn't working. I changed a constructor call in one activity, but didn't change it in the others so the app won't even run.

Also - learned some git! Came across it before, but now felt the need to learn it (how am I going to 'experiment' with code while keeping the working code intact?) This Youtube video is pretty informative without being overwhelming. He goes through some examples which makes it easier to understand. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc


### R1D2
Next task for Udacity's Miwok project (an app that teaches another language) is to add audio files (correct pronunciation) to each word. I had to create a separate small app to test out MediaPlayer. Very simple, it only has 2 buttons - play and pause.

Success! The best part is, it worked at first run!! How rare. I then added code to release resources on exit of the app.


### R1D3
Experimented with other functionality, added skip 10 seconds and rewind 10 seconds (getCurrentPosition and seekTo) to the mini project.

Went back to the Miwok project, next task is to add the little audio files for each word. Action plan: Add play button to the UI, save all the res files, modify Word class to relate the audio file to the correct word and set the onclick listener/method to play audio file.
