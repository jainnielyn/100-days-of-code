# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 3 - Jainnielyn Ching

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge, attempt# 3! This would mostly be a diary of my progress, not just focused on 1 hour of coding everyday. My goal is to work as a Python developer, not sure yet whether I'd prefer to be in data science (but machine learning sounds really cool!) or web development, so the plan is to create simple projects with both and see.

For the past few days, I have just been on leetcode as people on reddit say that's what you need to pass technical interviews, portfolio not necessary. However, I was in a Meetup the other day, and spoke to someone who has been a developer for 10+ years. He said that sadly there is a disconnect with interviews and the daily work life of developers. In interviews, they ask more Leetcode type of questions (data structures and algorithms). However, on the job, you'd be working on a codebase, or a project development from start to finish... So, yes, Leetcode is needed to pass interviews but portfolios are also needed as practice on what you'll actually be doing. 

## Log

### R1D1
I'm starting with data science/machine learning. CSDojo from Youtube recommended [Stanford's Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), and I found [IBM's Introduction to Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/introduction-data-science) (both from coursera).

Also looked up how to structure learning. When do I learn, when do I code?
