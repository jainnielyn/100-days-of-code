# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 3 - Jainnielyn Ching

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge, attempt# 3! This would mostly be a diary of my progress, not just focused on 1 hour of coding everyday. My goal is to work as a Python developer, not sure yet whether I'd prefer to be in data science (but machine learning sounds really cool!) or web development, so the plan is to create simple projects with both and see.

For the past few days, I have just been on leetcode as people on reddit say that's what you need to pass technical interviews, portfolio not necessary. However, I was in a Meetup the other day, and spoke to someone who has been a developer for 10+ years. He said that sadly there is a disconnect with interviews and the daily work life of developers. In interviews, they ask more Leetcode type of questions (data structures and algorithms). However, on the job, you'd be working on a codebase, or a project development from start to finish... So, yes, Leetcode is needed to pass interviews but portfolios are also needed as practice on what you'll actually be doing. 

## Log

### R1D1
I'm starting with data science/machine learning. CSDojo from Youtube recommended [Stanford's Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), and I found [IBM's Introduction to Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/introduction-data-science) (both from coursera).

Also looked up how to structure learning. When do I learn, when do I code?

### R1D2
I spoke with a few people, and it seems like I was mistaken. Data science is heavy on the math, and some roles don't even code much. Not the path for me. 

I like creating effecient solutions, or optimizing existing solutions. I do not care about front end, or design. I guess more on logic. Which means... back end. As I am now comfortable with Python, will be starting with web developer backend route. The other option is creating software (desktop/mobile), but it's a different stack and would set me back.

Also found [a pretty good guide](https://www.educative.io/blog/web-development-in-python#suited) on what technologies are needed to be a web developer.

### R1D3
Met someone who works in Google. He recommended I create a simple chat application using sockets to understand Python more. It would be local to my computer. Looked up a [tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-sockets/) with the [code in github](https://github.com/realpython/materials/tree/master/python-sockets-tutorial) and doing this today.

Started to understand how TCP connections work, client side and server side. Create the socket > bind > listen > connect > accept > send & receive > close. Created a super simple app that just echoes what the client has sent. However, connection terminates after just one line is sent. Want to enhance by being able to send multiple lines.

Tomorrow will continue with the tutorial on handling multiple connections.

### R1D4

It is a challenging concept to grasp, the sockets and selectors are quite foreign. It took a while, but I had a general understanding of the server side, will work on the client side tomorrow. 

### R1D5 

Understood how the client side works, but when I ran the scripts, there was unexpected output. A few print statements later, I still don't quite understand. Especially data.outb, when I try to print it out earlier in the function, it's empty. But it prints out a few lines later - it is not manipulated in between!

### R1D6 (Saturday, 15 August)

Not yet sure why that happens, but I found [a 5-part tutorial series in Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbfe3-v7yE0) which makes sockets easier to understand. 

### R1D7

Continued with the tutorial series, this method is more straightforward and easier to understand. He explains well. A new concept to grasp is bytes and encoding/decoding. I am up to the chatroom server bit, significantly more complex than the previous examples.
